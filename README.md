# Harry-Potter-and-The-Prisoner-Of-Azkaban-Fps-Fix
This is the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban FPS fix/ limmiter

These Launchers simply patch the game using the internal logic to put a cap on fps to solve issues inside the game relating to fps being to high with no way to limmit it.

you can choose from 60 or 120 fps launchers 

Simply put HP3-120FPSLauncher.exe or HP3-60FPSLauncher.exe OR BOTH into the games install location next to hppoa.exe (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban PC exe) 

use whichever launcher to run the game for whichever desired fps in game you wish to have. (double click the HP3-120FPSLauncher.exe or HP3-60FPSLauncher.exe to run the game with that chosen fps limit)
